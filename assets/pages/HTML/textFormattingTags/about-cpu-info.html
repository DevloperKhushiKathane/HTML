    <h3>DEFINATION OF CPU</h3>
    <P>A CPU is a computer's central processing unit.<br> It ia a circuit board that perform the basic function of a
        computer,such as airthamatic, logic, and input/output. <br>The CPU is the heart of the computer .<br> It is
        responsible
        for the processing of instruction and data, and for the execution of programs.</P>

        alt="Primary Memory" >
    <p>Primary memory, also known as main memory or RAM, is a computer's internal memory that the CPU can directly
        access. It's used to store data and instructions that the computer is actively using, enabling quick access and
        processing.</p>

    <h2>What is Secondary Memory?</h2>

        alt="Secondary Memory">
    <p>Secondary memory, also known as auxiliary or external memory, is a type of non-volatile computer memory that is
        not directly accessed by the CPU. It provides long-term data storage for files, applications, and the operating
        system. It is the memory thet stores the instruction that the CPU executes. It is also known as the "program
        memory".It is also known as secondary memory or RAM(Random Access Memory).</p>

    <h2>What is Processor?</h2>

    <p>A processor also known as CPU(Central Processing Memory).It is the brain of the computer.It's the hardware
        component that executes instruction about software and perform calculations,esentially controling all the
        operation.</p>
